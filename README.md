# MoCo Geeks ShadowSocks Service Usage Guidelines

Hi, thanks for using Geeks SS. ShadowSocks is a modified version of Socks5, which is a proxy tool. With Geeks SS, you can easily disguise yourself as a server hosted by us, without leaking your real device information including IP addresses and possibly geolocation. 

 **You are encouraged to use Geeks SS to: ** 

- Work on your individual or collaborative projects
- Create a fake LAN network and collaborate as if you are in the same WiFi
- Visit sketchy or suspicious websites that you don't fully trust (This is not recommended to try on your real machine - you can create a virtual machine to do that)
- Work on whatever is legal and appropriate 

 **However, you cannot use Geeks SS to:** 

- View, create, or contribute to any illegal or inappropriate information
- Bypass school network censorship - don't try, it won't work. We will figure out a way.
- Make profit in any way. You may not resell your account assigned to others, or mine bitcoins from our network, etc.
- Try to "hack" into MoCo Geeks database. Don't hack - contribute. You are already here.
- Publish information on the internet that may reveal our relationship with the IP address. We try to stay as anonymous as possible, so please don't ruin it.

You are given 50GB/month bandwith I/O for free. You're welcome. If you need more bandwidth, message Mingjie, and he will be able to offer you details about donating to the club to get unlimited bandwidth. Theoretically you will be able to get a max download speed of 120Mbps, but it may vary depending on your WiFi speed and your ISP.

You may do anything on the SS. You can even torrent, but that's not recommended as it will easily use up your bandwidth. You can get your current usage by asking Mingjie. You can connect to SS with any device running Android 4.2+, Windows 7+, MacOS, or others Linux/Unix distributions. Go to [shadowsocks.org](http://shadowsocks.org) to get the client software for your device. Number of devices per user is unlimited.

This project is currently fully funded and maintained by Mingjie. Donations appreciated - cash or PayPal accepted. If you run into any problem while using this service, talk to Mingjie.
